Description: 
    This package provides a tool to search and download a collection of tumour microenvironment 
    single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and their metadata. TMExplorer aims to act as a single 
    point of entry for users looking to study the tumour microenvironment at the single cell 
    level. Users can quickly search available datasets using the metadata table and then 
    download the ones they are interested in for analysis.
